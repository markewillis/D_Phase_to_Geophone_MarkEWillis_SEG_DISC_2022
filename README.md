# D_Phase_to_Geophone_MarkEWillis_SEG_DISC_2022

This gui demonstrates the complete cycle from phase angle to geophone response

The main gui function is D_Phase_to_Geophone_MarkEWillis_SEG_DISC_2022 which is built upon Mathworks MATLAB 2022a. Warning - versions earlier than 2021a will not run the software because the earlier versions don't allow for Greek symbols to be put into text strings on the gui for some reason.

You can install the application directly into your Matlab session using the D_Phase_to_Geophone_MarkEWillis_SEG_DISC_2022.mlappinstall file.

This software is a part of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists Distinguished Instructor Short Course given by Mark E. Willis in 2022-2023.
